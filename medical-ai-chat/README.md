## Patient Data Structure

The application uses a comprehensive patient data model including:

- **Patient Demographics:** Name, age, gender, MRN
- **Medical History:** Allergies, chronic conditions, surgical history
- **Current Medications:** Name, dosage, frequency, prescribing provider
- **Vital Signs:** Blood pressure, heart rate, weight, BMI
- **Laboratory Results:** Test results with reference ranges
- **Recent Visits:** Appointments with assessments and plans

## AI Assistant Capabilities

The AI assistant can intelligently respond to queries about:

1. **Medication Information**
   - Current prescriptions and dosages
   - Prescribing physicians
   - Medication schedules

2. **Allergy Management**
   - Known allergens and reactions
   - Severity levels
   - Contraindication warnings

3. **Vital Signs Analysis**
   - Current measurements
   - BMI calculations and interpretations
   - Trend analysis

4. **Laboratory Results**
   - Recent test results
   - Reference range comparisons
   - Abnormal value identification

5. **Medical History Review**
   - Chronic condition management
   - Surgical history
   - Treatment timelines

## Customization

### Adding New Patient Data
Replace the content in `src/summary.json` with your patient data following the established schema.

### Extending AI Responses
Modify the `generateAIResponse` function in `ChatInterface.tsx` to add new query patterns and responses.

### Styling Customization
- Update `tailwind.config.js` for theme modifications
- Modify CSS variables in `src/index.css` for color scheme changes
- Customize ShadCN components in `src/components/ui/`

## Development Notes

- The application uses TypeScript for type safety
- All components are built with accessibility in mind
- The design follows medical application UI/UX best practices
- State management is handled through React hooks
- The AI responses are simulated (no actual AI model integration)

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real AI/ML models for medical analysis
- Real-time patient data synchronization
- Multi-patient support with patient switching
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Export functionality for chat transcripts
- Integration with EHR systems
- Voice input/output capabilities
